# Note-Taker

## Description

For this assignment we were required to modify a starter code for a note taker and complete the routes so that the user can type in a note they want to remember and save it to the application. The user will also be able to save multiple notes and also delete them.

App is deployed on my heroku account: dk-note-taker
